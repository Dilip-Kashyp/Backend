# Express Products API

This is a simple Express.js API for managing products stored in a database. It provides endpoints to retrieve all products, get a specific product by its ID, and filter products by category and value.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/express-products-api.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd express-products-api
npm install
```

3. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

### Endpoints

- `GET /ping`: A simple endpoint to check if the server is running. Returns "pong" if the server is up.

- `GET /products`: Retrieves all products from the database.

- `GET /products/:id`: Retrieves a specific product by its ID.

- `GET /products/category/:category/:value`: Filters products by a specific category and value.

### Example Requests

- Retrieve all products:

```http
GET /products
```

- Retrieve a product by ID (replace `{id}` with the actual ID):

```http
GET /products/{id}
```

- Filter products by category and value (replace `{category}` and `{value}` with the actual category and value):

```http
GET /products/category/{category}/{value}
```

## Database

The products are stored in a separate module named `ProductsDB`. You can modify this module to add, update, or remove products as needed.

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
